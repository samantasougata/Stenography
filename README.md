#Project Title: Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography


Problem:
In today’s digital world, data security is a major concern.
Traditional encryption methods can raise suspicion.
There is a need for a method to hide secret messages inside images without noticeable changes.

Solution:
Using steganography, we can hide data within an image while keeping it visually unchanged.

Technology Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
cv2 (OpenCV) – for image processing
os – for file handling
Concept Used: Steganography (Hiding text inside an image)

Wow Factor
Simple yet powerful technique to hide messages.
No extra storage needed – messages are hidden inside an image itself.
Password-protected decryption, ensuring security.
Real-life applications like watermarking, secure communication, and digital forensics.

End Users
Cybersecurity Experts: For secure data transfer.
Journalists & Activists: To share information securely.
General Users: To store sensitive information hidden inside images.
Forensic Experts: For investigations and evidence protection.

Conclusion
Steganography is an effective method for secure communication.
The project successfully hides and retrieves secret messages inside images.
Future improvements can enhance security using AES encryption before embedding.

Future Scope
Enhanced Security: Encrypting messages before hiding them.
Support for Multiple Image Formats: PNG, BMP, etc.
Better Compression Techniques: To minimize changes in image quality.
Mobile & Web Integration: Making it a user-friendly tool.
